## Analysing Employee Performance for Hr Analytics Using Python and MySQL

![info.jpeg](images/info.jpeg)




***

## Data Source
I have used the data available at HiCounselor website (_[HR analytics data challenge, 2023](https://hicounselor.com/projects/analysing-employee-performance-for-hr-analytics-using-python-and-mygql)_). The dataset fulfils the requirements for the project and is in the CSV format.

# Data Analysis Concepts Demonstrated

__Data cleaning:__ 
- handling null values, 
- deletion or transformation of irrelevant values, 
- data type transformation, 
- removing duplicates and 
- data validations. 

__SQL Queries:__
- aggregating the data,
- grouping the data,
- ordering the data,
- using case
- sub queries etc

***

# Module 1: Data Preprocessing using python

- **Step 1**: Removing duplicate rows.
- **Step 2**: Removing rows for which numeric columns are having irrelevant data type values
- **Step 3**: Remove irrelevant values from each column if any. Validation all values for a column, Check for any inconsistencies or discrepancies in data types, units, or formats.Feel free to add more validation checks which you might feel necessary for the datasetâ€™s integrity
- **Step 4**: Export the cleaned dataset as a .csv file: prefer UTF-8 encoding.


```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings("ignore")


    #call read_data_from_csv to get dataframe
data=pd.read_csv('Uncleaned_employees_final_dataset.csv')

    # Remove duplicate rows
df=data.drop_duplicates(inplace=False)


    # Remove rows for duplicate values in a specific column
df = df.drop_duplicates(subset='employee_id')
    
    # Filter out rows with irrelevant data type values in numeric columns
numeric_columns = df.select_dtypes(include=['int', 'float']).columns
df_filtered = df[~df[numeric_columns].apply(lambda x: pd.to_numeric(x, errors='coerce').isna()).any(axis=1)]
    
    # Remove rows with NaN values in a specific column
df_filtered = df_filtered.dropna(subset=['education'])
    

    #export cleaned Dataset to newcsv file named "hrAnalytics_cleaned.csv"
df_filtered.to_csv('hrAnalytics_cleaned.csv')


```

***

# Module 2: Data Analysing using SQL

In this module, SQL will be used to perform data analysis on the pre-processed data from the previous module. 


```python
import sqlite3

# Load the CSV file into a DataFrame
fdf = pd.read_csv('hrAnalytics_cleaned.csv')

# Create a SQLite in-memory database and establish a connection
conn = sqlite3.connect(':memory:')

# Store the DataFrame in a SQL table
fdf.to_sql('employee', conn, index=False)
```

## Task 1
- **Find the average age of employees in each department and gender group.**
- **(Round average age up to two decimal places if needed).**



```python
##code

query = "SELECT department,gender, round(avg(age),2) as avg_age FROM employee group by 1,2"
result = pd.read_sql_query(query, conn)

# Display the query result
print(result1)

```

query = "select department,recruitment_channel,round(avg(length_of_service),2) as avg_LoS from employee  where KPIs_met_more_than_80 =1 and previous_year_rating=5 and age between 25 and 45  group by 1,2 order by 3 desc  limit 5"

result = pd.read_sql_query(query, conn)

# Display the query result
print(result)
